<title>Конфигурационные файлы OTRS</title>

<para>
All OTRS configuration files are stored in the directory
<filename>Kernel</filename> and in its subdirectories. There is no need to
manually change any other file than <filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename>,
because the rest of the files will be changed when the system gets
updated. Just copy the configuration parameters from other files into
<filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename> and change them as per your
needs. This file will never be touched during the update process, so your
manual changes are safe.
</para>

<para>
The configuration can be rebuilt either manually by executing <literal>perl
bin/otrs.Console.pl Maint::Config::Rebuild</literal> or automatically by the
installer, package operations (install, update, reinstall and uninstall),
etc. All <filename>.xml</filename> files located in
<filename>Kernel/Config/Files/XML/</filename> are parsed and their content
is transferred to the OTRS database. Most of the <filename>.xml</filename>
files which are part of this directory by default belong to OTRS Free, but
OTRS Free Features such as FAQ or Survey (or any other OTRS extension) will
add their own configuration files to this directory as well.
</para>

<para>
To apply any sort of changes to the configuration, it is necessary to deploy
them. The deployment process will extract all settings and the according
values from the OTRS database, convert them to a format that OTRS can
understand naturally and put them into
<filename>Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAAuto.pm</filename>.
</para>

<para>
If the OTRS web interface is accessed, the settings contained in the files
<filename>Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAAuto.pm</filename>,
<filename>Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZACL.pm</filename> (if existing),
<filename>Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZProcessManagement.pm</filename> (if
existing) and any other custom <filename>.pm</filename> file will be
evaluated alphabetically. These files are used by the graphical user
interface for caching purposes and should never be changed manually. Lastly,
the file <filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename> that contains your individual
settings and manually changed configuration parameters will be
parsed. Reading the configuration files in this order makes sure that your
specific configuration settings are considered correctly by the system.

</para>

<para>
OTRS Free currently brings more than 1700 configuration settings, and there
are different ways to quickly access a specific one. With the full text
search, all configuration settings can be scanned for one or more
keywords. The full text search not only searches through the names of the
configuration settings, but also the descriptions and values. This allows an
element to be found easily even if its name is unknown.
</para>

<para>
Furthermore, each configuration setting is classified by a category and a
navigation group. Navigation groups are individual elements in the main
navigation tree. By selecting one of these navigation entries, all settings
assigned to the selected group will be shown. As long as no extensions are
installed, the category selection is automatically hidden, but as soon as a
package is installed which brings its own configuration settings (such as
FAQ or Survey), the category selection will be revealed. Selecting a
category makes the main navigation tree show only the navigation groups
belonging to the selected category.
</para>

<para>
All configuration settings are shown as readonly by default. To edit a
setting, click the "Edit this setting" button that appears on hovering your
mouse cursor over a setting. Once edit mode has been entered, changes made
to the fields from within the setting can be saved by clicking the save
button on the right (or by hitting the enter key on your keyboard). If a
setting is currently edited by another administrator, it is not possible to
get access to the edit mode for that setting until the other administrator
finished their work. Editing can be cancelled by clicking the cancel button
on the right or hitting the <emphasis>Escape</emphasis> key on your
keyboard. When editing is cancelled, all changes made during the current
editing session are discarded.
</para>

<para>
Clicking the setting name or the menu icon on the the top right of each
setting will reveal a menu with some more options (e.g. enable/disabled a
setting, reset a settings values to their defaults, copy a direct link to a
setting or add a setting to a list of favorites for quick access).
</para>

<para>
To bring changes into effect, a deployment has to be started. The system
configuration deployment screen shows a list of the settings which are to be
deployed. Clicking the arrow icon on the top left of each setting or in the
outer <emphasis>Changes Overview</emphasis> box will show a one to one
comparison between the settings current state (which is about to be
deployed) and the previous (or default) state.
</para>

</para>

<para>
If you would like to save all the changes you made to your systems
configuration (for example to quickly set up a new instance) you can use the
<emphasis>Export settings</emphasis> button, which will provide a
<filename>.yml</filename> file for downloading. To restore your own
settings, use <emphasis>Import settings</emphasis> and select the .yml file
you have created before.
</para>

<note>
<para>
For security reasons, the configuration settings for the database connection
cannot be changed in the graphical user interface of the system
connfiguration. These have to be set manually in
<filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename>.
