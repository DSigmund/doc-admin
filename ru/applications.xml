You can install additional application packages to extend the functionality
of the OTRS framework. This can be done via the package manager in the
adminarea, which downloads the applications from an online repository and
manages package dependencies. It is also possible to install packages from
local files, in case your OTRS system does not have a direct internet
connection.
