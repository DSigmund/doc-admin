            <para>
                Once different calendars are created, it is possible to export either the

well-known YAML format or just export the related appointments of a calendar
to ICS format.

appointments to an existing calendar using ICS file uploads.
            </para>

            <para>
                If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new
or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
an agenda overview.
            </para>
            <para>
                Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit
and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on their
permission level to the related calendars. Such appointments can be created
or edited via drag and drop within this screen.
            </para>
            <para>
                The visibility of single calendars can be enabled or disabled through the
calendar list within the screen.

            <para>
                To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars

view modes, like weekly view, monthly view, different timeline related views
etc.
            </para>
            <para>
                Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of
all available (accessible) calendars in a table-like overview. This overview
is designed to have a detailed list of upcoming appointments in a structured
table. Like in the calendar overview, appointments can be created, edited or
deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on
available appointments.

templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
or setup a custom point of time.
            </para>
            <para>

can be created, updated and/or deleted to react on different OTRS events
with related filters, recipients and content templates.
            </para>
            <para>

start and end dates.
