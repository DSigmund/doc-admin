            The article attachment overview enables you to view a list of all
attachments in a ticket. Attachments will be listed by attributes such as
file name, file type, file size, date of addition and which article they
belong to. From the overview screen, you can download certain attachments or
create an archive file which contains multiple or all attachments of the
ticket you're viewing.
