<title>Basics about trouble ticket systems</title>

<abstract>
<para>
This chapter gives a short overview about the idea of trouble tickets in
general and trouble ticket systems in specific. A short example shows the
advantages of using a ticket system.

<title>What is a trouble ticket system and why do you need it?</title>

<para>
The following example describes what a trouble ticket system is and how you
can save time and money if you use such a system in your company.
</para>

<para>
Let's imagine that Max is a manufacturer who produces video recorders.
Since programming video recorders is very complex, Max gets many mails from
customers who need help with the devices. Some days, Max has not enough time
to answer all mails so that his customers have to be patient until they get
an answer. Some customers don't want to wait that long so they write a
second mail with the same question. All mails containing support requests
are stored in only one inbox file. The requests are not sorted and Max
answers the mails with a regular email program.
</para>

<para>
Then the developers Joe and John have to help Max answer the mails because
Max can't reply fast enough to all the messages. Since Max, Joe and John use
the same system with the same inbox file, they all access the same
inbox. Joe and John don't know that Max often got two identical requests
from a desperate customer. So Joe answers the first and John answers the
second mail of the customer, both with a helpful hint on how to solve the
problem. The customer receives two different answers, and Max does not know
what John and Joe wrote. Max neither has an overview about the replies of
Joe and John nor does he know all the problems the customers have had with
the video recorders nor which problems occur very often nor how much time
and money he has to spend for customer support.
</para>

<para>
At a meeting, a colleague tells Max about trouble ticket systems and that
they can solve Max's problems with the customer support. After looking for
information on the Internet, Max decides to install the Open Ticket Request
System (OTRS) on a computer that is accessible from the web by both his
customers and his employees. Now, the customer requests are no longer sent
to Max's private inbox but to the mail account that is used for OTRS. The
ticket system is connected to this mailbox and saves all requests in its
database. For every new request, the system generates an auto-answer and
sends it to the customer so that the customer knows that his request has
arrived and will be answered soon. OTRS generates an explicit reference, the
ticket number, for every single request. Now, the customers are happy
because they receive a quick response to their requests and it is not
necessary to send a second message with the same question. Max, John and Joe
can now login into OTRS with a simple web browser and answer the
requests. Since the system locks a ticket that is answered, no message is
edited twice.
</para>

<para>
Let's imagine that Mr Smith makes a request to Max's company and his message
is processed by OTRS. John gives a brief reply to this request but Mr Smith
has an additional question so he replies to John's mail. Since John has
other things to do, Max answers Mr Smith's message. The history function of
OTRS makes it easy for Max to read both Mr Smith's first message and John's
response so that he is able to write a more detailed reply to Mr Smith. Mr
Smith does not know that two different people were involved in the
communication, he is happy about the solution for his problem that arrived
with Max's last reply.
</para>

<para>
Of course, this is only a short overview about the possibilities and
features of trouble ticket systems. But if many customer requests (mails and
phone calls) must be handled by different people, a ticket system can help
to save time and money. A ticket system helps you to structure your support
or help desk environment and you can define work flow processes. The
communication between customers and companies will become more transparent
which results in more effectiveness for both customers and support staff.

<title>What is a trouble ticket?</title>

<para>
You can compare a trouble ticket with medical report for a hospital
patient. A medical report is generated when the patient visits the hospital
for the first time. All important data about the patient, such as personal
data and facts about medical issues, are stored in the medical report.  Each
doctor adds information on the illness and any medication to the medical
report so that all doctors and the nursing staff can get a quick and
detailed overview about the patient's situation. When the patient has
recovered and leaves hospital, the medical report is closed and all
information is archived.
</para>

<para>
Trouble ticket systems such as OTRS handle trouble tickets like normal
email.  The messages are saved in the system. When a customer sends a
request, a new ticket is generated by the system which is comparable to a
new medical report being opened. The answer to this new ticket can be
compared to a doctor's entry in the medical report, a new answer to a change
in the clinical picture of the patient. A ticket is finished if an answer is
send back to the customer or if the ticket is closed by the system. If a
customer sends an answer for a already closed ticket, the ticket will be
reopened and the new information will be added. To keep the consistency of
all data in the system, every ticket is stored and archived with all
relevant information. Since tickets are handled like normal emails,
attachments will be stored, too. Notes can be added as additional
information to every email. All tickets are stored on the hard drive or in
the database of the system. Also additional information like notes, dates,
employees involved, working time needed for a ticket etc. are stored. All
tickets can be sorted and it is possible to search through all data.
