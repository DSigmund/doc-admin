<para>
Dieses Buch soll das Leben von OTRS-Administratoren und -Neulingen
erleichtern. Die folgenden Kapitel beschreiben Installation, Konfiguration
und Administration des Ticket-Systems. Daher ist das Buch f√ºr Agenten oder
Kunden weniger interessant.

<para>
Although many hours of work, some litres of coffee and several pizzas were
invested into the following sections, it is still not complete. Inevitably
there will be errors, parts with complicated explanations or missing
chapters about important things. Some chapters will be reworked or new
chapters and sections will be added.
