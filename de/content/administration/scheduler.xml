    <title>OTRS Scheduler</title>
    <para>
        The OTRS Scheduler is an independent system process that executes tasks in
background. These kind of processes are know as <emphasis>daemons</emphasis>
in Unix / Linux systems or as <emphasis>services</emphasis> on Windows
environments. It is independent but that doesn't mean that the Scheduler
does everything alone, it is fully integrated into OTRS and can use any OTRS
module as needed to complete each task.
    </para>
    <para>
        Currently the OTRS Scheduler is only able to handle Generic Interface
tasks. These kind of tasks executes invokers that send requests to remote
systems. Other handlers for different tasks will be added in future OTRS
versions.
    </para>
    <para>
        For sanity reasons the Scheduler process needs to be restarted from time to
time. This is done automatically by the scheduler process itself once a day,
but it can be adjusted as needed using the SysConfig by editing the
"Scheduler::RestartAfterSeconds" setting.
    </para>
    <para>
        The OTRS Scheduler is a set it and forget it process, the only needed human
interaction is to check its status periodically and start or stop it as
needed.
    </para>
    <note>
        <para>
            If the Scheduler is stopped for any reason all pending tasks and new tasks
registered when the Scheduler is stopped will be executed as soon as the
Scheduler starts again (unless the tasks are set to be executed in the
future).
        </para>
    </note>
    <section id="scheduler-gui">
        <title>Scheduler Graphical Interface</title>
        <para>
            The Scheduler is not visible in the OTRS Graphical User Interface unless it
stops running.
        </para>
        <section id="scheduler-gui-notify">
            <title>Scheduler Not Running Notification</title>
            <para>
                There are two different types of notifications if the system detects that
scheduler is not running. This detection is based on the Scheduler process
update frequency, if the difference between current time and the last
process update time is 2 times the process update frequency a warning
message will be displayed in the OTRS notification area. If it is over 4
times the process frequency then an alert will be displayed instead.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Scheduler process update time can be configured via the SysConfig in the
"Scheduler::PIDUpdateTime" setting.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you would see a warning message it is not always necessary to take an
action, but is highly recommended to check if the scheduler process is
running. If you see an alert, then is highly probable that the scheduler is
in fact not running and should be started.
            </para>
            <para>
                By default the Scheduler not running notification is enabled, if there is a
valid web service registered in the database, and is only displayed to the
users in the "admin" group.
            </para>
            <para>
                To disable the notification (not recommended) or to change or add the
notification groups, please edit the
"Frontend::NotifyModule###800-Scheduler-Check" setting in the SysConfig.

                By clicking on the Scheduler not running notification link (either warning
or alert) a dialog box will open to let you start the Scheduler process
again. The Scheduler can be started normally or forced to start, by clicking
on the appropriate check box in the dialog.

                    A forced Scheduler start is only necessary if previous Scheduler process was
terminated abnormally and the Process ID is still registered in the

                        Force start or stop are only necessary if starting the process is needed to
be done before the process update time expires. Otherwise an expired entry
in the database would be discarded by a normal start.
