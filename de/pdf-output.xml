<title>Customize the PDF output</title>

<para>
This section handles the configurable options for PDF output in OTRS.
</para>

<para>
If you would use the Print action from anywhere within the OTRS interface,
this would generate a formatted PDF file. You can deactivate this by
modifying the configuration parameter <link
linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF"> PDF </link> . In that case, HTML output
will be used instead.</para>

<para>You can adjust the look of the files generated by OTRS by creating your own
logo and add it to <link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::LogoFile">
PDF::LogoFile </link>.  You can use <link
linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::PageSize"> PDF::PageSize </link> to define
the standard page size of the generated pdf file (DIN-A4 or Letter) and
<link linkend="Framework:Core::PDF:PDF::MaxPages"> PDF::MaxPages </link>
specifies the maximum number of pages for a pdf file, which is useful if a
user tries to generate a very big output file by accident.
</para>

<para>
The Perl CPAN modules PDF::API2 and Compress::Zlib, must be installed for
the generation of pdf files. In many distributions they are available as
packages and can be easily installed, using the respective package
manager. In case this is not possible, they have to be installed with
CPAN. For further information about installing Perl modules, please refer to
the <link linkend="installation-of-perl-modules"> "Installation of Perl
modules" </link> chapter.
