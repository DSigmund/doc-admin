            A dynamic field is a special kind of field in OTRS, created to extend primary the
            information stored on a ticket or article. This fields are not fixed in the system and
            they can appear only in specific screens, they can be mandatory or not, and their
            representation in the screens depends on the field type defined at their creation time
            according to the data to be hold by the field. e.g there are fields to hold a text, a
            date, a selection of items, etc.

            Dynamic fields are the evolution of TicketFreeText TicketFreeKey TicketFreeTime,
            ArticleFreeText and ArticleFreeKey Fields that where commonly used in OTRS 3.0 and
            before, the limitation of this "Free Fields" was that they can be defined up to 16
            (text or dropdown) fields and 6 time fields for a ticket and 3 (text or dropdown)
            fields for each article.
        </para>
        <para>
            Now with dynamic fields the limitation in the number of fields per ticket or article is
            removed, you can create as many dynamic fields you like either for ticket or articles.
            And beyond that, the framework behind the dynamic fields is prepared to handle custom
            fields for other objects rather than just ticket and articles.

        <para>
            This new framework that handles the dynamic fields is build over a modular approach,
            where each kind of dynamic field can be seen as a plug-in module for the framework, this
            means that the variety of dynamic fields can be easily extended by OTRS modules,
            OTRS Feature Add-ons, OTRS Custom developments, and other custom developments.
