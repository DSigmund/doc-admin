<title>Ticket responsibility and ticket watching</title>

<para>
From OTRS 2.1 on, it is possible to define a person responsible for a ticket,
additionally to its owner. Moreover, all activities connected with the
ticket can be watched. These two functionalities are implemented with
the TicketResponsible and TicketWatcher features, and facilitate the
assignment of tasks and working within hierarchic team structures.

<title>Ticket responsibility</title>

<para>
The ticket responsible feature facilitates the complete processing of a ticket
by an agent, other then the ticket owner. Thus an agent who has locked a
ticket can pass it on to another agent, who is not the ticket owner, in order for
the second to respond to a customer request. After the request has been dealt
with, the first agent can withdraw the ticket responsibility from the
second agent.
</para>

<para>
With the configuration parameter

<link linkend="Ticket:Core::Ticket:Ticket::Responsible" >
Ticket::Responsible
</link>

, the ticket responsible feature can be activated. This will cause that 3 new icons appear
in your toolbar.
</para>

<para>
Ticket responsibility can be assigned by calling up the ticket content and
clicking on the "Responsible" link in the actions bar of a zoomed ticket in
the agent interface (see the Figure 9.1 below).
