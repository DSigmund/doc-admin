<title>The admin area of OTRS</title>

<section id="adminarea-general">
<title>Basics</title>

<para>
This is the central place for OTRS administrators. Here you can alter your
configuration, install additional packages, such as FAQ and ITSM; add
queues and agents, and much more.</para>

<para>
Agents who are members of the <emphasis>admin</emphasis> group can access the
administrators area, by clicking the <emphasis>Admin</emphasis>
link, in the navigation bar (see Figure 5.1 below); the rest of the agents won't
see this link. On a new installation you can log in with the user
<emphasis>root@localhost</emphasis> and the password
<emphasis>root</emphasis>.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
Please change the password for this account as soon as possible via the

<link linkend="user-preferences">

<para>
By clicking the link <emphasis>Agent</emphasis> you get access to the agent management
of OTRS (see Figure 5.2 below). Administrators can add, change or deactivate agent's accounts.
Administrators can also manage agent's preferences, for instance, the language
of their interface and notification settings.
</para>

<note>
<para>
To keep the consistency of the data for OTRS it is not possible to delete any agent's
account, but only deactivate them. To do so, set them to

After the new account has been created, you should make the agent a member of one or more
groups or roles. Therefore, you will be redirected automatically to the appropriate screen.

<title>Groups</title>

<para>
Groups are very important in OTRS and every agent's account should at least
belong to one group or role. In a brand new installation, there are three pre-defined
groups available, as it is defined in the Table 5-1.

        By default, the QueueView only lists tickets in queues that an

            Ticket::Frontend::AgentTicketQueue###ViewAllPossibleTickets

<section id="adminarea-roles">
<title>Roles</title>

<para>
Roles are a very powerful and helpful feature to manage the access rights of many
agents in a very simple and fast way. Therefore, it is ideal to save time on big and
complex systems, that have a lot of agents, groups and queues.
</para>

<para>
To explain the advantages of the role feature, suppose that you have a system with
100 agents, 90 of them have access only to a queue called "support", where all support
requests are handled. The "support" queue contains some sub queues. The other 10 agents
have permission to access all queues of the system, they are not restricted only to the
support queue. These 10 agents dispatch tickets, watch the raw queue and move spam
messages into the "junk" queue.
</para>

<para>
Some day, the company opens a new department that sells products. Offerings, confirmations
of offerings, bills, etc. must be created and some of the agents in your system shall do
this via OTRS. The different agents have to get access to the new queues that must be
created.
</para>

<para>
Because it would take a long time to change the access rights for the different agents
manually, roles that define the different access levels can be created. Then the agents
can be added to one or more roles, therefore, their rights will automatically get changed.
If a new agent account is created, it is also possible to add this account to one or more roles.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Roles are really useful when maintaining larger OTRS installations. You should
not use both Agent to Group and Agent to Role mappings at the same time though,
this would make maintenance really hard. Thence, if you decide to go with
roles, we'd recommend you to to disable the Agents &lt;-&gt; Groups option in
the Admin area, by modifying the
<link linkend="Framework:Frontend::Admin::ModuleRegistration:Frontend::Module_AdminUserGroup">
    Frontend::Module###AdminUserGroup
</link>
in the SysConfig. Be aware that this won't remove already existing Agents to Group
assignments!</para>

You can access to the role management (see Figure 5.8 below ) by clicking the

OTRS supports different types of users. Using the link "Customers" (via the navigation bar
or the admin area), you can manage the accounts of your customers (see Figure 5.14 below),
who can can log into the system via the customer interface (customer.pl). Through this
interface, your customers can create tickets and access to them. It is importan to know
that a customer is needed for the ticket history in the system.

You can define an unlock timeout for a queue, i.e., if an agent locks a ticket and
does not close it before the unlock timeout has passed, the ticket will be automatically
unlocked and hence, available for other agents.
</para>

<para>
There are three escalation time settings that can be associated at queue level:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - First Response Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
If there is not customer interaction added, either email-external or phone, to a new ticket
before the time defined here expires, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - Update Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
If there is an article added, such as a follow-up, via e-mail or the customer portal, the
escalation update time is reset. If there is no customer contact, either email-external or
phone, added to a ticket before the time defined here expires, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<itemizedlist>
    <title>Escalation - Solution Time</title>
    <listitem>
        <para>
If the ticket is not set to closed before the time defined here expires, the ticket is escalated.
        </para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
With 'Ticket lock after a follow-up' you can define if a ticket should be set to 'locked'
to the old owner if a ticket that has been set to closed and later is re-opened. This ensures
that a follow up for a ticket is processed by the agent that has previously handled that ticket.
</para>

<para>
The parameter for the system address specifies the email address that will be used for the outgoing
tickets of this queue. There is also possibility to associate a queue to a salutation and a signature,
for the email answers. For more detailed information, please refer to the sections

Because the content of a salutation can be created dynamically, for example,
for things that change for every ticket (sender's name or email address), it is
possible to use variables in salutations. Thus, if you reply a ticket, the variable
names will be replaced for their real content, i.e., the text which is saved in
the variables.
</para>

<para>
The different variables you can use in responses are listed in the lower
part of the salutation screen. If you use, for example, the variable
&lt;OTRS_LAST_NAME&gt; the last name of the ticket's sender  will be
included in your reply.
</para>

<note>
<para>
To keep the consistency of the data for OTRS it is not possible to delete
salutations, but only deactivate them. To do so, set them to

<section id="adminarea-signatures">
<title>Signatures</title>

<para>
Another text module for a response is the signature. Signatures can be
linked to a queue, as described in the section about the

<link linkend="adminarea-queue">
queues
</link>

. Only if a signature is linked to a queue it will be included into the
response text. Through "Signatures" link of the admin area, you can manage the
signatures in your system (see Figure 5.22 below).

Like salutations, signatures can also contain dynamical content (e.g. the first

the content of the signature text for every ticket. See the lower part of

the variable &lt;OTRS_LAST_NAME&gt; in a signature for example, the last name of
the agent who answers the ticket will replace the variable's name.

a salutation and a signature. A response is assembled by different text
modules. The signature and the salutation of the queue, where the ticket is
stored, are two of the text modules of the response and also the original
ticket text and, if defined, the text of the response is included. The
different text modules are ordered in a way that first the salutation is displayed,
then the quoted ticket text, after that, the text of the response comes, and finally,
the signature is shown.

A filter consists of one or more criteria that must match for the defined
actions to be executed. You can define filter
criteria for the headers or the body of an email, e.g. search for specific
header entries or strings in the body, even regular expressions are
allowed. All actions for a filter rule are triggered by X-OTRS headers,
which are inserted if the filter criteria match. The ticket system
evaluates the inserted X-OTRS headers and executes the specific actions.
X-OTRS headers can be used to sort an incoming message into a specific
queue, change the priority of the message or ignore the message and deliver
it not to the system. The Table 5-4 lists the different X-OTRS
headers and their meaning.

<para>
A name must be specified for every filter rule. In the section for "Match"
the filter criteria can be specified. Choose via the listboxes for
"Header 1", "Header 2" and so on the parts of the messages where you would
like to search and specify via the input files on the right sides the
values. In the section for "Set" you can choose the actions that are
triggered, if the filter rules match. You can select for "Header 1",
"Header 2" and so on the X-OTRS-Header and set the values (see Figure 5.48 below).

<example id="sort-mails-into-junk">
<title>Sort spam mails into a specific queue</title>

<para>
A useful filter rule could be to let OTRS automatically sort mails marked for
spam with a spam detection tool, such as SpamAssassin, into the "Junk" queue.
SpamAssassin adds the "X-Spam-Flag" header to every checked mail.
When the mail is marked as spam, the Header is set to "Yes". So the filter criteria
would be "X-Spam-Flag: Yes". To create a filter rule with this criteria you can
insert the name for example "spam-mails". Also choose in the section for
"Match" for "Header 1" from the listbox "X-Spam-Flag:". Insert "Yes" as
value for this header. Now the filter criteria is specified. To make sure,
that all spam mails get sorted into the "Junk" queue choose in the section for
"Set" for "Header 1" the "X-OTRS-Queue:" entry. Specify "Junk" as value for
this header. Finally add the new filter rule to activate it for the next
new messages in the system.
