        <para>
            Ticket and appointment calendar notifications can be sent to their recipients using one or multiple methods.
            Every notification can activate its preferred method to be sent, and by default all notifications are sent
            using the email method, where the information about the notification is embedded into an email for the
            recipient.
        </para>
        <para>
            However, OTRS offers more transportation methods to send the notifications, please take a look below for
            their configuration and usage.

        <para>
            This transportation method is only intended for agents and instead of actually sending the notifications in
            any form, they are stored in the system database in order to be displayed in an special screen in the agent
            interface.
