    <title>OTRS Scheduler</title>
    <para>
        The OTRS Scheduler is an independent system process that executes tasks in background. These
        kind of processes are know as <emphasis>daemons</emphasis> in Unix / Linux systems or as <emphasis>services</emphasis> on Windows
        environments. It is independent but that doesn't mean that the Scheduler does everything alone, it is fully
        integrated into OTRS and can use any OTRS module as needed to complete each task.
    </para>

    <para>
        For sanity reasons the Scheduler process needs to be restarted from time to time. This is
        done automatically by the scheduler process itself once a day, but it can be adjusted as
        needed using the SysConfig by editing the "Scheduler::RestartAfterSeconds" setting.
    </para>
    <para>
        The OTRS Scheduler is a fully automated process, the only needed human interaction is to
        check its status periodically and start or stop it as needed.
    </para>
    <note>
        <para>
            If the Scheduler is stopped for any reason, all pending tasks and new tasks registered when the
            Scheduler is stopped will be executed as soon as the Scheduler starts again
            (unless the tasks are set to be executed in the future).
        </para>

        <title>Scheduler Graphical Interface</title>
        <para>
            The Scheduler is not visible in the OTRS Graphical User Interface unless it stops running.

            <title>Scheduler Not Running Notification</title>
            <para>
                There are two different types of notifications if the system detects that the scheduler is not
                running. This detection is based on the update frequency  of the Scheduler process. If
                the difference between current time and the last process update time is 2 times the
                process update frequency a warning message will be displayed in the OTRS
                notification area. If it is over 4 times the process frequency then an alert will
                be displayed instead.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Scheduler process update time can be configured via the SysConfig in the
                "Scheduler::PIDUpdateTime" setting.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you see a warning message it is not always necessary to take an action, but it is
                highly recommended to check if the scheduler process is running. If you see an alert,
                then there is a high chance that the scheduler is in fact not running and should be
                started.
            </para>
            <para>
                By default the Scheduler not running notification is enabled, if there is a
                valid web service registered in the database, and is only displayed to the
                users in the "admin" group.
            </para>
            <para>
                To disable the notification (not recommended) or to change or add the
                notification groups, please edit the
                "Frontend::NotifyModule###800-Scheduler-Check" setting in the SysConfig.

                By clicking on the Scheduler not running notification link (either warning or
                alert) a dialog box will open to let you start the Scheduler process again. The
                Scheduler can be started normally or forced to start, by clicking on the
                appropriate check box in the dialog.

                <para>
                    A forced Scheduler start is only necessary if previous Scheduler process was

                    OTRS provides init.d scripts to start / stop the OTRS Scheduler process

                    The init.d scripts need to be copied to the correct location for your operating

                    need to be set to work properly. If you used the OTRS RPMs to set up the system,
                    this is taken care of automatically.

                    On Windows, the OTRS Scheduler is registered as a Service
                    via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM). In order to have the OTRS Scheduler
                    process to be controlled by the SCM is necessary to register this service.
                    If you used the Windows Installer this is taken care of by the installer, and there
                    are no manual actions required.

                        before you can register the service correctly.
