                        to another system, after the agent''s request has been answered (e.g. when a ticket has been created). Otherwise, it might block the response,

            With the Generic Interface, new web services can be configured easily by using existing OTRS modules, without additional code. They can be combined to
            create a new web service. When configuring a new web service connection, the administrator has to add:

    <title>Hardware and software requirements</title>

    <para>
    OTRS can be installed on many different operating systems. OTRS can run on
    linux and on other unix derivates (e.g. OpenBSD or FreeBSD). You can also run
    it on Microsoft Windows. OTRS does not have excessive hardware requirements. We
    recommend using a machine with at least a 2 GHz Xeon or comparable
    CPU, 2 GB RAM, and a 160 GB hard drive for a small setup.
    </para>

    <para>
    To run OTRS, you'll also need to use a web server and a database server.
    Apart from that, you should install perl and/or install
    some additional perl modules on the OTRS machine.
    The web server and <application>Perl</application> must be installed on the same machine
    as OTRS. The database back-end may be installed locally or on another host.
    </para>

    <para>
    For the web server, we recommend using the <application>Apache HTTP Server</application>, because
    its module mod_perl greatly improves the performance of OTRS. Apart from that,
    OTRS should run on any web server that can execute Perl scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
    You can deploy OTRS on different databases. You can choose between <application>MySQL</application>,
     <application>PostgreSQL</application>, <application>Oracle</application>, or
    <application>Microsoft SQL Server</application>.
    If you use <application>MySQL</application> you have the advantage that the database
    and some system settings can be configured during the installation, through a web front-end.
    </para>

    <para>
    For <application>Perl</application>, we recommend using at least version
    5.8.8. You will need some additional modules which can be installed either with
    the Perl shell and CPAN, or via the package manager of your operating system
    (<application>rpm</application>, <application>yast</application>,
    <application>apt-get</application>).

        <para>
        If you install a binary package of OTRS, which was built for your operating
        system (rpm, Windows-Installer), either the package contains all Perl
        modules needed or the package manager of your system should take care of the
        dependencies of the Perl modules needed.

            To use OTRS, you'll be OK if you use a modern browser with JavaScript support enabled.
            We do not support the following browsers:

        <para>
            We recommend always using the latest version of your browser, because it has the best JavaScript and rendering performance.
            Dramatical performance varieties between the used browsers can occur with big data or big systems.
            We are happy to consult you on that matter.
