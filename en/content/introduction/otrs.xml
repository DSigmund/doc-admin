            OTRS is separated into several components. The main component is the
            OTRS framework which contains all central functions for the application and the
            ticket system. It is possible to install additional applications such as OTRS::ITSM modules, integrations

                                    Completely revamped ticket zoom screen, with a fresh new design with accent on content. User avatars have been introduced as a visual aid for easier identification of the article sender. Article display settings are now displayed in a settings dialog.

                                    Dropped dubious and somewhat confusing article types, and introduced the concept of communication channels as source for ticket articles (e.g. Email, Phone, Chat, etc). Customer visibility of articles can now be determined by a simple check-box.

Now it's possible to select to which kind of ticket an article should be split: phone (default), email or process ticket. For process tickets, additional selection of specific process will be provided. However, only those fields which are configured in the first activity dialog will be adopted from original ticket.

                                    Added support for ticket number and title search in ticket merge and bulk screens. Auto-complete list can be used to populate the ticket number field with a single click, therefore speeding up the process and limiting room for error. In the ticket merge screen, there is also a CustomeriD search filter option, which will limit the results to tickets belonging to the same customer company as the source ticket.

                            Added completely new log mechanism for email communications. The dashboard-like display allows administrators to quickly see what might be wrong in their system regarding receiving and sending emails. Account overview can be used to determine which mail accounts might be having issues and why. Detailed logging should help figuring out how an email was processed by the system before ending up in a specific ticket.

        <title>Hardware and Software Requirements</title>

        <para>
        OTRS can be installed on many different operating systems. OTRS can run on
        linux and on other unix derivates (e.g. OpenBSD or FreeBSD).
        OTRS does not have excessive hardware requirements. We
        recommend using a machine with at least a 3 GHz Xeon or comparable
        CPU, 8 GB RAM, and a 256 GB hard drive.
        </para>

        <para>
        To run OTRS, you'll also need to use a web server and a database server.
        Apart from that, you should install perl and/or install
        some additional perl modules on the OTRS machine.
        The web server and <application>Perl</application> must be installed on the same machine
        as OTRS. The database back-end may be installed locally or on another host.
        </para>

        <para>
        For the web server, we recommend using the <application>Apache HTTP Server</application>, because
        its module mod_perl greatly improves the performance of OTRS. Apart from that,
        OTRS should run on any web server that can execute Perl scripts.
        </para>

        <para>
        You can deploy OTRS on different databases. You can choose between <application>MySQL</application>,
         <application>PostgreSQL</application> or <application>Oracle</application>.
        If you use <application>MySQL</application> or <application>PostgreSQL</application> you have the advantage that the database
        and some system settings can be configured during the installation, through a web front-end.
        </para>

        <para>
        For <application>Perl</application>, you will need some additional modules which
        can be installed either with the Perl shell and CPAN, or via the package manager of your operating system
        (<application>rpm</application>, <application>yast</application>,
        <application>apt-get</application>).

                We recommend keeping your browser up-to-date. JavaScript and rendering performance in newer versions is always improved.
                Dramatic performance issues can be seen in larger systems when using older versions. We are happy to consult you on
                that matter.
