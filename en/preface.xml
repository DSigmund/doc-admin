<para>
	This book wants to make life easier for OTRS administrators
	and OTRS newbies. The following chapters describe the installation,
	configuration and administration of the ticket system, making this book
	less interesting for agents or customer users.

<para>
	Although many hours of work, some litres of coffee and several pizzas were
	invested into the following sections, it is still not complete. Inevitably
	there will be errors, parts with complicated explanations or missing chapters about
	important things. Some chapters will be reworked or new
	chapters and sections will be added.
